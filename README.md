I developed a clone of the Myntra website utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features functionality such as the 'Add to Bag' option and 
calculates the total price of items selected. The 'Add to Bag' feature allows users to select products they wish to purchase, adding them to their shopping bag. 
Simultaneously, the application dynamically updates the total cost of the items in the bag, providing users with an instant calculation of their potential expenditure. 
This clone not only mimics the look and feel of Myntra's interface but also replicates key functionalities that enhance user experience, making online shopping seamless and efficient.
